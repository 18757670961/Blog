## Website Recommendation (Graphic Design)

some pretty useful websites for graphic designers

------

For those who are designing your great pieces, here are some useful sites you're recommended to visit. They are here to provide you with some basic visual principles, tips for a specific tool, inspiration from others or just make your life easier. Even if you're not a so-called designer, you can also utilize these sites to get some amazing inspirations when making a PPT, etc. This list will get updated as soon as I come across something interesting, but you could still contribute by adding those you know in the forum below 😉
